I don't know. I have a large tensor of type float64. Calling `torch.linalg.svd`on it produces this error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIntel MKL ERROR: Parameter 12 was incorrect on entry to DGESDD.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n/tmp/ipykernel_3300/2679862595.py in <module>\r\n----> 1 torch.linalg.svd(tensor)\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: falseINTERNAL ASSERT FAILED at \"/opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1634272068185/work/aten/src/ATen/native/LinearAlgebraUtils.h\":244, please report a bug to PyTorch. svd_cpu: Argument 12 has illegal value.

I can reproduce in master. cc @username_2\n<issue_comment>username_2: The problem is related to https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/51720.\r\n\r\nThe optimal workspace size for the input of this size is `2.70021e+09` which doesn't fit into `int` type. In PyTorch, we use a 32-bit interface to backend linear algebra libraries.\r\nWe can \"fix\" the internal assert with this patch\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp b/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp\r\nindex 853f5c2cbe..8902958d98 100644\r\n--- a/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp\r\n+++ b/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp\r\n@@ -2984,7 +2984,9 @@ static void apply_svd(Tensor& self, Tensor& U, Tensor& S, Tensor& VT,\r\n   int lwork = -1;\r\n   scalar_t wkopt;\r\n   lapackSvd<scalar_t, value_t>(jobz, m, n, self_data, lda, S_data, U_data, lda, VT_data, ldvt, &wkopt, lwork, rwork_data, iwork_data, &info);\r\n-  lwork = std::max<int>(1, real_impl<scalar_t, value_t>(wkopt));\r\n+  TORCH_CHECK(\r\n+      (real_impl<scalar_t, value_t>(wkopt)) < INT_MAX,\r\n+      \"svd: The optimal workspace size is larger than allowed by 32-bit interface to backend math library.\");\r\n   Tensor work = at::empty({lwork}, self.options());\r\n   auto work_data = work.data_ptr<scalar_t>();\r\n```\r\nThe issue is likely there for other functions as well and we could include checks of the values before casting them to int.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 will there be any way around this in the future for large SVDs? Or is there an upper size limit due to the 32bit interface?\n<issue_comment>username_2: Unfortunately, there is no workaround available.\r\nFrom the MKL documentation the workspace size (`lwork`) can be computed using these guidelines:\r\n```\r\nFor real flavors:\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'N', lwork ≥ 3*min(m, n) + max (max(m,n), 6*min(m, n));\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'O', lwork ≥ 3*(min(m, n))2 + max (max(m, n), 5*(min(m, n))2 + 4*min(m, n));\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'S' or 'A', lwork ≥ 3*(min(m, n))2 + max (max(m, n), 4*(min(m, n))2 + 4*min(m, n))\r\n\r\nFor complex flavors:\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'N', lwork ≥ 2*min(m, n) + max(m, n);\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'O', lwork ≥ 2*(min(m, n))2 + max(m, n) + 2*min(m, n);\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'S' or 'A', lwork ≥ (min(m, n))2 + max(m, n) + 2*min(m, n);\r\n```\r\n`lwork` must be smaller than `2147483647` (maximum `int`) in order to not hit the limitation of the 32-bit interface.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Any clue as to why `svdvals` and `eigvalsh` work?\n<issue_comment>username_1: For what is worth, `svdvals` and `eigvalsh` may work in master when the input does not require gradients, as we do not compute the `U` and the `Vh` in those cases, so the working space needed is less than for the full SVD /

This is a quick fix so we can ship a patch release.\n<issue_comment>username_1: This is hard to follow for me. What is your mental model for when it's safe and/or necessary to mutate `baseState`? How does this relate to `processUpdateQueue` that also mutates it?\n<issue_comment>username_1: In particular I'm worried that a low-pri update can mutate `baseState` and then get interrupted. What guarantees we'll \"disregard\" that state-from-props next time we process a high pri update?\n<issue_comment>username_0: We mutate `baseState` whenever we process the update queue. It represents the state before any of the updates in the queue are applied. It's different from `memoizedState` whenever we process an update but keep it in the queue. This happens when there are lower priority updates than what we're currently rendering, because we skip the low ones and come back to them later — i.e. it's what makes this work:\r\n\r\n![react explainer slides 004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3624098/38271779-3720625c-373c-11e8-93a6-7a30e00d02f3.png)\r\n\r\nMy mental model for `getDerivedStateFromProps` is a `setState` inside render, at the same priority as what we're currently rendering:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  this.setState((previousState, previousProps) => {\r\n    if (previousProps !== this.props) {\r\n      return getDerivedStateFromProps(this.props, previousState);\r\n    }\r\n    return null;\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we actually implemented it this way, then `processUpdateQueue` would have taken care of updating `baseState` and this bug probably wouldn't have happened. We decided not to use the `updateQueue` to implement `getDerivedStateFromProps` because we wanted to avoid adding updates to the current queue, which shares a persistent structure. I thought it would be more elegant. But this bug indicates that it's more complicated than we thought, and we should reconsider. This is one of the things I will address in my follow-up PR.\n<issue_comment>username_2: But the `nextState` prop passed to `componentWillUpdate` would have been incorrect.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 What's a `componentWillUpdate`?\n<issue_comment>username_3: Hi @username_0 I just wanted to point out that my getDerivedStateFromProps() _stopped working_ in my React 16.3.0., but as soon as I updated it to **16.3.1.**, it _started working again_. \r\nThanks. \r\nHowever, my **forceUpdate** -inside getDerivedStateFromProps()- stopped working. Maybe it's related?\n<issue_comment>username_1: `this.forceUpdate` (an instance method) is not supposed to work inside `getDerivedStateFromProps` (a static method). Why are you trying to use it? `getDerivedStateFromProps()` should be pure and have no side effects.\n<issue_comment>username_3: @username_1 Before, I just had some logic that used forceUpdate() inside componentWillReceiveProps(). Particularly, I used it in a Google Maps component. As the map receives dropdown values, I wanted to show/hide InfoWindows for particular markers. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, since React is preparing ground for async an such, will refactor it as per your comment. \r\n\r\nThanks again.\n<issue_comment>username_3: I agree, very hard coded. \r\nThis is what I had before for showing/hiding InfoWindows for current on-screen markers, you can see the `forceUpdate()` thrown in there. \r\n```\r\nif (newProps.dropFiscValue !== this.props.dropFiscValue) {\r\n      const obj1 = {}; //=> Markers, InfoWindows upon Dropdown Fiscalizacion Value\r\n      obj1.markersFisc = {};\r\n      obj1.iWsFisc = {};\r\n      obj1.iWVisibleFisc = {};\r\n\r\n      fisc_data.map((marker, index) => {\r\n        // mapping over Área Inversiones data\r\n\r\n        if (newProps.dropFiscValue === marker.empresa_responsable2) {\r\n          const index2 = 'marker' + index.toString(); // id for Markers\r\n          const markerFisc = {};\r\n\r\n          const index3 = 'marker' + index.toString() + 'IW'; // id for infoWindows\r\n          const iWFisc = {};\r\n\r\n          const index4 = 'marker' + index.toString() + 'IW' + 'IsVisible'; // id for infoWindows State\r\n          const iWState = {};\r\n          iWState[index4] = false;\r\n\r\n          iWFisc[index3] = (\r\n            <InfoWindow\r\n              key={marker.consec * -1}\r\n              lat={marker.latitud}\r\n              lng={marker.longitud}\r\n              content={\r\n                '<h2>' +\r\n                marker.nombre_del_proyecto +\r\n                '</h2> <hr/>' +\r\n                '<b><b>' +\r\n                marker.empresa_responsable +\r\n                '</b></b><br/>' +\r\n                '<b>Fase: </b>' +\r\n                marker.fase +\r\n                '<br />' +\r\n                '<b>Dimensión (MW): </b>' +\r\n                marker.dimesion +\r\n                '<br />' +\r\n                '<b>Inicio Planificación: </b>' +\r\n                marker.fecha_inicio_planemiento +\r\n                ' <br />' +\r\n                '<b>Fin Factibilidad y Evaluación: </b>' +\r\n                marker.fecha_fin_fact_eval +\r\n                ' <br />' +\r\n                '<b>Gasto Preinversión (millones de colones): </b>' +\r\n                marker.gasto_preinv_millones_col +\r\n                ' <br />' +\r\n                '<b>Inspección ARESEP: </b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.aresep.go.cr\">I-Cuatr 2018 (Ver Informe).</a> <br /> <br />' +\r\n                '<u><b>Descripción</b></u>: ' +\r\n                marker.justificacion +\r\n                '<br /><br />'\r\n              }\r\n              onCloseClick={evt => {\r\n                if (!iWState[index4]) {\r\n                  iWState[index4] = true;\r\n                  obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4];\r\n                  obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = iWFisc[index3];\r\n                  this.forceUpdate();\r\n                } else {\r\n                  iWState[index4] = false;\r\n                  obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4];\r\n                  obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = false;\r\n                  this.forceUpdate();\r\n                }\r\n              }}\r\n            />\r\n          );\r\n\r\n          markerFisc[index2] = (\r\n            <Marker\r\n              key={marker.consec}\r\n              lat={marker.latitud}\r\n              lng={marker.longitud}\r\n              icon={'https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/MBJZhRRpeFe3YuCMbciA'}\r\n              title={marker.nombre_del_proyecto}\r\n              opacity={0.9}\r\n              onClick={evt => {\r\n[Truncated]\n                  iWState[index4] = false;\r\n                  obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4];\r\n                  obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = false;\r\n                  this.forceUpdate();\r\n                }\r\n              }}\r\n            />\r\n          );\r\n          Object.assign(obj1.markersFisc, markerFisc); // obj1.markersFisc[index2] = markerFisc[index2]; // put markers under its own root\r\n          obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = iWState[index4]; // small trick, under IW put all false, then on clicks, update them accordingly\r\n          obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4]; // IW state\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      this.setState(prevState => {\r\n        return { obj1 };\r\n      }); // state set: newly created obj\r\n      console.log('----------');\r\n    }\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_1: Wow, this is really complex. Why isn't this logic in the render function?\n<issue_comment>username_3: Yes, it is complex. so sorry.\r\nThe reason for this complexity is because the React Google Map wrapper is coded in a way to accept React components as children and render them, i.e.:\r\n`<Gmaps ...props>\r\n  <Marker lat={...} lng={...} ...props> _{/* this is a marker for a location */}_\r\n  <Marker lat={...} lng={...} ...props> _{/* this is a marker for another location */}_\r\n  <Marker lat={...} lng={...} ...props> _{/* and so on, and so forth */}_ \r\n</Gmaps>\r\n`\r\nAccording to the Dropdown values, the markers will be mounted/unmounted to the map (via react children components). And, inside each rendered marker, I have set an `onClick` prop for showing/hiding those rendered markers' infowindows individually (hence, the `forceUpdate()`).\r\nI guesss I should take this last logic out of the `onClick` props and render them in a different way, although still atached to each rendered markers, mmm...\n<issue_comment>username_1: Are you familiar with [React data flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) in general?\r\n\r\nTypically instead of manually managing a list of children like this, your render method should have something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet markers = [];\r\n\r\n// fill these markers based on state\r\n// ...\r\n// and then render them\r\n\r\nreturn <Gmaps>{markers}</Gmaps>\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_3: Actually yes, I am using that in my render.\r\nParticularly, upon deciding what markers to render (due to the Dropdowns), I create small containers, i.e.:\r\n`const objMarkersElecCont = Object.values(this.state.obj1.markersElec);`\r\nthen, I let React conditionally render (because there may be markers or not on-screen), i.e.:\r\n`{Array.isArray(objMarkersElecCont) ? objMarkersElecCont : false}`\n<issue_comment>username_1: I'd just suggest not putting React elements into state.

This is done outside of the React event handler (ie: via `window.addEventLIstener` and so the updates are not batched together. The update to render the numbers is artificially slowed down. \r\n\r\nIf you click the \"Increment Remote Count\" button multiple times, the update works as expected. \r\n\r\nIf you interrupt the update, via clicking the \"increment local count\" \r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Steps to reproduce look like: \r\n1. Click the \"Increment Remote Count\" button once\r\n2. Before the update is committed to the DOM, click the \"Increment Local Count\" update. \r\n3. The first update is \"lost\" ie; the output looks like: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/787007/68468141-27255f80-0263-11ea-9afb-07964e21d9d9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jwenc.csb.app/ \\ https://codesandbox.io/s/usesubscriptionconcurrentlosingupdates-jwenc \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'd expect there to be a commit as the above screenshot, but I'd then expect there to be a follow-up commit that restores the consistency. In other words, I'd expect in the above picture for everything to be `1` \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n`0.0.0-experimental-f6b8d31a7`\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to try to take a stab at writing a React test for this, if needed?\n<issue_comment>username_1: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16396#issuecomment-547193356\r\nHere's codesandbox I created.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Started looking into why this happens - https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17336\r\n\r\nSeems like an issue somewhere in `updateSimpleMemoComponent`\n<issue_comment>username_1: Maybe related: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17318#issuecomment-552167774\n<issue_comment>username_2: yes i already signaled here : https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17318#issuecomment-552160358\n<issue_comment>username_3: Reported similar issue some time ago: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17028<issue_closed>\n<issue_comment>username_4: Thanks for the bug report!\r\n\r\nI believe this was fixed by https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/18091\r\n\r\nYou can confirm using `react@0.0.0-experimental-ea6ed3dbb` and `react-dom@react@0.0.0-experimental-ea6ed3dbb`.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue, but if the bug persists please comment and we'll reopen.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Rebased https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17336/files and the test was green - thanks!\n<issue_comment>username_4: @username_0 Thank you for that PR!

{"question":{"chain_of_thought":"The text mentions a potential issue with C++ extensions in the context of global visibility of symbols from libtorch_python. It suggests that if the symbols are not globally visible in the current process, the C++ extensions would fail to load at runtime even though they compile successfully. The question should probe further into the reason behind this behavior and how global visibility affects the loading of C++ extensions in this scenario.","question":"Why would C++ extensions fail to load at runtime if the symbols from libtorch_python are not globally visible?","answer":"C++ extensions would fail to load at runtime if the symbols from libtorch_python are not globally visible because the extensions require these symbols to have global visibility in the current process for successful loading. Without global visibility, the extensions are unable to access the necessary symbols during runtime, leading to loading failures despite compiling without any issues."},"source":{"id":382,"context":"<issue_start><issue_comment>Title: Add hidden visibility to _C.so\nusername_0: See

I don't know how easy that is to do. (Maybe this is a reason not to use pybind11, but that ship has kind of sailed...)\n<issue_comment>username_3: If everything works on MSVC with its default option -- that is, no exposure unless explicitly asked to -- could replacing all occurrences of `__declspec(dllexport)` with something also compatible with `gcc` work? Like something similar to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8258786/1150462)?\n<issue_comment>username_0: Yes, I realized that it needs adjusting annotations.\r\n\r\nAs @username_3 pointed out, we should have already annotated all the right things to make Windows work. But we use windows-only macro in THP_API/THP_CLASS (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/THP_export.h).

This is done so that we can send these bytes across the network and reconstruct the needed information on the remote end.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed some slowness in this python serialization, namely in use cases with a large number of remote trainers being set up as an RRef on a master/parameter server node. In setups like these, the following pattern is quite common:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# On parameter server\r\nmodel = create_model(...)\r\nfor trainer_name in trainers:\r\n    trainer_rref = rpc.remote(\r\n        _setup_model_on_trainer,\r\n        model,\r\n        ...additional arguments, expensive to serialize\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in the loop while the dst worker is different, the function and arguments being serialized are the same. This may mean that caching the serialized representation from call to call could be useful, speeding up the end to end latency. For speeding up individual calls, we can look into parallelizing the serialization, which will be more complex than simple caching as the parallelization would have to be implemented in the C++ layer.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn some training workloads, we have noticed serialization taking up a large portion of time when initializing the setup discussed above. Since many of these workloads follow the pattern above, caching/parallelization should be a good candidate to speed this up. \r\n\r\n## Pitch\r\nImplement caching similar to the demo here: and evaluate its impact on the above described workloads. If parallelization across arguments in individual calls also sounds like it makes sense and is likely to result in a speedup, we can discuss a concrete implementation plan to move the pickling into C++ to take advantage of multiple cores.\n<issue_comment>username_1: From the demo PR, looks like the args can contain a lot of small tensors. If that's the common case, RDMA in TensorPipe won't be sufficient. cc @username_2 and @beauby  for this use case. \r\n\r\nA follow-up question is in which layer we should put this caching/serialization logic? Probably not in TensorPipe to avoid over-complicating the comm layer. Two other options are in RPC or layers on top of RPC (e.g., applications, or helpers). Will it work if we provide a new decorator for RPC functions? E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@rpc.functions.enable_caching\r\ndef my_function_to_cache(*args):\r\n    pass\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_2: Are you sure this is really feasible? I thought pickling requires holding the GIL, which would mean that even if it's done in C++ it cannot be done in parallel by multiple threads. Unless you were talking about TorchScript pickling, but as I said above that should already be faster, without any changes required in RPC, right?\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 True, after some more thought I agree moving pickling into C++ won't likely give us too much since we would need to immediately grab the GIL. TorchScript in general is our recommendation for improved performance and if this code were indeed TorchScripted, it would go through TS pickling, but some use cases may not be able to fully TorchScript their training loop. I think we can probably still proceed with the caching portion of this RFC, though.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Sorry for the late reply, but we are actually trying to cache the results of pickling (python) args and functions themselves, not the actual result of the function. The idea is that many trainers issue the same RPCs and do (potentially) expensive pickling, when we could just be returning a cached result. Caching for application functions is tricky due to issues like idempotency and would probably be best handled by the user app (or we can provide the decorator as you mentioned).\n<issue_comment>username_2: One issue with caching the pickled data is mutability. The application might know that the data won't change between two calls, but PyTorch doesn't and thus it would have to check, which could potentially be as slow as just pickling again.\r\n\r\nI wonder if, as a start, we could fix this in the application: the user could _explicitly_ pickle what it wants to send over, obtain `bytes` objects for it, send those `bytes` as arguments of the RPC call, and have the remote function unpickle them back. This might be easier said than done, since if the values contain tensors it could get tricky. \r\n\r\nMaybe we should first try a few variations of these potential solutions in the application, and

True, after some more thought I agree moving pickling into C++ won't likely give us too much since we would need to immediately grab the GIL. TorchScript in general is our recommendation for improved performance and if this code were indeed TorchScripted, it would go through TS pickling, but some use cases may not be able to fully TorchScript their training loop. I think we can probably still proceed with the caching portion of this RFC, though.","issue_id":775646482,"issue_number":49911,"timestamp":"2021-01-13T10:27:44","chunk_id":"12343b20ba1f2bf6b690371a07b33630"}}

Launch a build from source of pytorch with `USE_VULKAN ON` and `USE_VULKAN_SHADERC_RUNTIME ON`\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well -->\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\nIt should compile without having to force C++20 manually, CMakeLists should handle that, or C++20 features should be removed.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n - PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): 1.8.0\r\n - OS (e.g., Linux): Windows 10\r\n - How you installed PyTorch (`conda`, `pip`, source): I build from source\r\n - Build command you used (if compiling from source): Probably something like `cmake -G \"Ninja\" -DUSE_VULKAN=ON -DUSE_VULKAN_SHADERC_RUNTIME ..` then `cmake --build .`. But I'm packaging libtorch for conan with all third party libraries unvendored, so there is a level of abstraction between conan call and actual build command call + a big patch to fix CMakeLists of libtorch (I didn't change CXX_STANDARD behavior)\r\n - Python version: 3.9.1\r\n - CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A (disabled)\r\n - GPU models and configuration: Doesn't really matter here\r\n - Any other relevant information:\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n```\r\n[177/1263] Building CXX object

working branch [here](https://github.com/username_1/pytorch/tree/chesterliu/dev%2Fvulkan-on-win). Check it out if you're interested.\r\n\r\nBe aware that even though the library works, a large number of operators are not implemented in the Vulkan backend, which makes the usage of Vulkan backend

🐛 Bug\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\nBuild from source (directly invoke CMakeLists) with `USE_VULKAN ON` fails due to usage of C++20 features in libtorch source code.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Launch a build from source of pytorch with `USE_VULKAN ON` and `USE_VULKAN_SHADERC_RUNTIME ON`\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well -->\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\nIt should compile without having to force C++20 manually, CMakeLists should handle that, or C++20 features should be removed.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n - PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): 1.8.0\r\n - OS (e.g., Linux): Windows 10\r\n - How you installed PyTorch (`conda`, `pip`, source): I build from source\r\n - Build command you used (if compiling from source): Probably something like `cmake -G \"Ninja\" -DUSE_VULKAN=ON -DUSE_VULKAN_SHADERC_RUNTIME ..` then `cmake --build .`. But I'm packaging libtorch for conan with all third party libraries unvendored, so there is a level of abstraction between conan call and actual build command call + a big patch to fix CMakeLists of libtorch (I didn't change CXX_STANDARD behavior)\r\n - Python version: 3.9.1\r\n - CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A (disabled)\r\n - GPU models and configuration: Doesn't really matter here\r\n - Any other relevant information:\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n```\r\n[177/1263] Building CXX object

This is a quick fix so we can ship a patch release.\n<issue_comment>username_1: This is hard to follow for me. What is your mental model for when it's safe and/or necessary to mutate `baseState`? How does this relate to `processUpdateQueue` that also mutates it?\n<issue_comment>username_1: In particular I'm worried that a low-pri update can mutate `baseState` and then get interrupted. What guarantees we'll \"disregard\" that state-from-props next time we process a high pri update?\n<issue_comment>username_0: We mutate `baseState` whenever we process the update queue. It represents the state before any of the updates in the queue are applied. It's different from `memoizedState` whenever we process an update but keep it in the queue. This happens when there are lower priority updates than what we're currently rendering, because we skip the low ones and come back to them later — i.e. it's what makes this work:\r\n\r\n![react explainer slides 004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3624098/38271779-3720625c-373c-11e8-93a6-7a30e00d02f3.png)\r\n\r\nMy mental model for `getDerivedStateFromProps` is a `setState` inside render, at the same priority as what we're currently rendering:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  this.setState((previousState, previousProps) => {\r\n    if (previousProps !== this.props) {\r\n      return getDerivedStateFromProps(this.props, previousState);\r\n    }\r\n    return null;\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we actually implemented it this way, then `processUpdateQueue` would have taken care of updating `baseState` and this bug probably wouldn't have happened. We decided not to use the `updateQueue` to implement `getDerivedStateFromProps` because we wanted to avoid adding updates to the current queue, which shares a persistent structure. I thought it would be more elegant. But this bug indicates that it's more complicated than we thought, and we should reconsider. This is one of the things I will address in my follow-up PR.\n<issue_comment>username_2: But the `nextState` prop passed to `componentWillUpdate` would have been incorrect.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 What's a `componentWillUpdate`?\n<issue_comment>username_3: Hi @username_0 I just wanted to point out that my getDerivedStateFromProps() _stopped working_ in my React 16.3.0., but as soon as I updated it to **16.3.1.**, it _started working again_. \r\nThanks. \r\nHowever, my **forceUpdate** -inside getDerivedStateFromProps()- stopped working. Maybe it's related?\n<issue_comment>username_1: `this.forceUpdate` (an instance method) is not supposed to work inside `getDerivedStateFromProps` (a static method). Why are you trying to use it? `getDerivedStateFromProps()` should be pure and have no side effects.\n<issue_comment>username_3: @username_1 Before, I just had some logic that used forceUpdate() inside componentWillReceiveProps(). Particularly, I used it in a Google Maps component. As the map receives dropdown values, I wanted to show/hide InfoWindows for particular markers. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, since React is preparing ground for async an such, will refactor it as per your comment. \r\n\r\nThanks again.\n<issue_comment>username_3: I agree, very hard coded. \r\nThis is what I had before for showing/hiding InfoWindows for current on-screen markers, you can see the `forceUpdate()` thrown in there. \r\n```\r\nif (newProps.dropFiscValue !== this.props.dropFiscValue) {\r\n      const obj1 = {}; //=> Markers, InfoWindows upon Dropdown Fiscalizacion Value\r\n      obj1.markersFisc = {};\r\n      obj1.iWsFisc = {};\r\n      obj1.iWVisibleFisc = {};\r\n\r\n      fisc_data.map((marker, index) => {\r\n        // mapping over Área Inversiones data\r\n\r\n        if (newProps.dropFiscValue === marker.empresa_responsable2) {\r\n          const index2 = 'marker' + index.toString(); // id for Markers\r\n          const markerFisc = {};\r\n\r\n          const index3 = 'marker' + index.toString() + 'IW'; // id for infoWindows\r\n          const iWFisc = {};\r\n\r\n          const index4 = 'marker' + index.toString() + 'IW' + 'IsVisible'; // id for infoWindows State\r\n          const iWState = {};\r\n          iWState[index4] = false;\r\n\r\n          iWFisc[index3] = (\r\n            <InfoWindow\r\n              key={marker.consec * -1}\r\n              lat={marker.latitud}\r\n              lng={marker.longitud}\r\n              content={\r\n                '<h2>' +\r\n                marker.nombre_del_proyecto +\r\n                '</h2> <hr/>' +\r\n                '<b><b>' +\r\n                marker.empresa_responsable +\r\n                '</b></b><br/>' +\r\n                '<b>Fase: </b>' +\r\n                marker.fase +\r\n                '<br />' +\r\n                '<b>Dimensión (MW): </b>' +\r\n                marker.dimesion +\r\n                '<br />' +\r\n                '<b>Inicio Planificación: </b>' +\r\n                marker.fecha_inicio_planemiento +\r\n                ' <br />' +\r\n                '<b>Fin Factibilidad y Evaluación: </b>' +\r\n                marker.fecha_fin_fact_eval +\r\n                ' <br />' +\r\n                '<b>Gasto Preinversión (millones de colones): </b>' +\r\n                marker.gasto_preinv_millones_col +\r\n                ' <br />' +\r\n                '<b>Inspección ARESEP: </b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.aresep.go.cr\">I-Cuatr 2018 (Ver Informe).</a> <br /> <br />' +\r\n                '<u><b>Descripción</b></u>: ' +\r\n                marker.justificacion +\r\n                '<br /><br />'\r\n              }\r\n              onCloseClick={evt => {\r\n                if (!iWState[index4]) {\r\n                  iWState[index4] = true;\r\n                  obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4];\r\n                  obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = iWFisc[index3];\r\n                  this.forceUpdate();\r\n                } else {\r\n                  iWState[index4] = false;\r\n                  obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4];\r\n                  obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = false;\r\n                  this.forceUpdate();\r\n                }\r\n              }}\r\n            />\r\n          );\r\n\r\n          markerFisc[index2] = (\r\n            <Marker\r\n              key={marker.consec}\r\n              lat={marker.latitud}\r\n              lng={marker.longitud}\r\n              icon={'https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/MBJZhRRpeFe3YuCMbciA'}\r\n              title={marker.nombre_del_proyecto}\r\n              opacity={0.9}\r\n              onClick={evt => {\r\n[Truncated]\n                  iWState[index4] = false;\r\n                  obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4];\r\n                  obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = false;\r\n                  this.forceUpdate();\r\n                }\r\n              }}\r\n            />\r\n          );\r\n          Object.assign(obj1.markersFisc, markerFisc); // obj1.markersFisc[index2] = markerFisc[index2]; // put markers under its own root\r\n          obj1.iWsFisc[index3] = iWState[index4]; // small trick, under IW put all false, then on clicks, update them accordingly\r\n          obj1.iWVisibleFisc[index4] = iWState[index4]; // IW state\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      this.setState(prevState => {\r\n        return { obj1 };\r\n      }); // state set: newly created obj\r\n      console.log('----------');\r\n    }\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_1: Wow, this is really complex. Why isn't this logic in the render function?\n<issue_comment>username_3: Yes, it is complex. so sorry.\r\nThe reason for this complexity is because the React Google Map wrapper is coded in a way to accept React components as children and render them, i.e.:\r\n`<Gmaps ...props>\r\n  <Marker lat={...} lng={...} ...props> _{/* this is a marker for a location */}_\r\n  <Marker lat={...} lng={...} ...props> _{/* this is a marker for another location */}_\r\n  <Marker lat={...} lng={...} ...props> _{/* and so on, and so forth */}_ \r\n</Gmaps>\r\n`\r\nAccording to the Dropdown values, the markers will be mounted/unmounted to the map (via react children components). And, inside each rendered marker, I have set an `onClick` prop for showing/hiding those rendered markers' infowindows individually (hence, the `forceUpdate()`).\r\nI guesss I should take this last logic out of the `onClick` props and render them in a different way, although still atached to each rendered markers, mmm...\n<issue_comment>username_1: Are you familiar with [React data flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) in general?\r\n\r\nTypically instead of manually managing a list of children like this, your render method should have something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet markers = [];\r\n\r\n// fill these markers based on state\r\n// ...\r\n// and then render them\r\n\r\nreturn <Gmaps>{markers}</Gmaps>\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_3: Actually yes, I am using that in my render.\r\nParticularly, upon deciding what markers to render (due to the Dropdowns), I create small containers, i.e.:\r\n`const objMarkersElecCont = Object.values(this.state.obj1.markersElec);`\r\nthen, I let React conditionally render (because there may be markers or not on-screen), i.e.:\r\n`{Array.isArray(objMarkersElecCont) ? objMarkersElecCont : false}`\n<issue_comment>username_1: I'd just suggest not putting React elements into state.

If I remove this logic to reuse the grad_accumulator: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/autograd/variable.cpp#L209 and always create a new grad_accumulator, it seems to fix the TSAN issue.\n<issue_comment>username_1: Thanks for the report.\r\nThe `set_next_edges` is called on the Node that each thread creates so why would that race? The AccumulateGrad Node doesn't have its next edges set.\r\n\r\nAlso does this repro without the distributed autograd engine being involved?\n<issue_comment>username_0: Distributed autograd engine is not involved since this is still the forward pass. The multithreaded behavior comes from the fact that multiple RPCs are using the same tensor.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Most likely it is the same issue as https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/58442, and this is expected.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Could you clarify why this is expected behavior? It seems really fragile that using a Tensor with `requires_grad=True` from multiple threads can cause inconsistencies in the autograd graph even if the user is only reading from the Tensor.\n<issue_comment>username_2: There are two potential races related to topological_nr that I think TSAN could be complaining about, but both should be non-issues:\r\n1. There is a potential write-write race where two nodes A, B in two threads try to set their next edge to the same node C. This leads to both threads trying to write the `_has_parent` field of C at the same time. There is no correctness issues here though because they are both writing the same value `true`. \r\n\r\n2. There is another write-read race. When a node calls set_next_edges, as to enforce the invariant of topological numbers it will first verify that if its own `_has_parent` is not `true`. In theory there is a race where this node's own `_has_parent` field is being set in one thread (because another node is calling set_next_edge to it), and this node is calling set_next_edges on a separate thread. If this happens, it can lead to correctness issues, but in practice whenever we construct a new node we always call set_next_edges right afterwards, so no other thread should have access to the node at that time.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 I see, so can we probably make `_has_parent` atomic with memory_order_relaxed so that TSAN doesn't complain about this?\n<issue_comment>username_1: What would be the perf implication of this change?\n<issue_comment>username_3: Just slapping memory_order_relaxed doesn't mean TSAN won't complain about it (c.f. https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1009 ). An atomic with the correct memory order, however, is the right fix, and should give you the same x86 instructions in the end (no perf hit).\n<issue_comment>username_1: Good point!

Something like \"Element ref was specified as a string (myRef) but no owner was set.\" could be better. In the case that it's neither string nor function, you could say \"Expected ref to be a function or a string\".\n<issue_comment>username_2: Maybe also let's not include `commitAttachRef(...)` there? It's not very useful to us since there's only one such invariant, and it's confusing to the user since it shows an internal method name as if they were expected to know what it means,\n<issue_comment>username_0: Ah - I meant we could reuse the warning wording and docs from the old warning that gets thrown in 15.* - https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html\r\n\r\nBut I think you are right, we should give a specific error for this case, and probably a new docs page similar to https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html\r\n\r\nI spent a while trying to write a test for this, and wasn't able to reproduce the error in the test environment. I was trying to use '[jestResetModules](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/jest-object.html#jestresetmodules)' to load and use a second copy of React, and it seemed to work, but the error wasn't triggered.\r\n\r\nThis is what I tried: https://gist.github.com/username_0/46f744f6981f1f35861ef4cdeba67af1\r\n\r\nSince we didn't have a test for the old warning (Refs must have owner) we could merge this without a test.\r\n\r\nWriting a fixture that reproduces the error seems easier, but I don't want to commit to the overhead of checking it manually.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I can't find any way to trigger the case where 'In the case that it's neither string nor function, you could say \"Expected ref to be a function or a string\".' so I'm not putting too much thought into that message, but I guess it makes sense to add that invariant since we *do* expect it to be a string or a function.\n<issue_comment>username_1: What happens if you do ref={17} or ref={{abc: true}}?\n<issue_comment>username_0: It doesn't complain for `ref={17}`, `ref={{abc: true}}`. The only thing I found to pass to `ref` that throws is `ref={Function}` and I think that is bad syntax, not really worried about someone doing that.\n<issue_comment>username_0: And now it has a test! Thank youuuuuu @username_2 🏎️\n<issue_comment>username_0: I thought it would be more clear that way - looking now for patterns that are used currently.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I'll update it to all be in one `it(...` assertion.\n<issue_comment>username_1: I guess I am confused why there needs to be a branch at all. Is the behavior not the same?\n<issue_comment>username_0: For the record, we talked more about why there needs to be a different branch for 'fiber' and 'stack' versions of this behavior; the new

Namely, because `componentWillMount` is called, but `componentDidMount` is not.\r\n\r\nAt the least, this should be documented on the lifecycle docs page. There was also discussion about changing the method names. (Note: there's clearly a need for both hooks; the only issue is that name of the former conveys that the component will mount when, in fact, it won't.)\r\n\r\nOne possibility is to add another always-run phase before the mounting phase which is run when rendered to string or DOM (e.g. \"prepare\" or \"initialize\"). The lifecycle would then be easily explained as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare the compoent\r\n2. Mount the component (if rendering to DOM)\r\n3. Render the component for the first time.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to contribute a PR for either docs, method names, or both once a decision is reached.\n<issue_comment>username_1: We do want to support

This inlines those calls as it is a critical rendering path. Through testing a chat example I have found about a 10-15% performance gains through benchmark.js.\r\n\r\nTest: https://github.com/username_0/react-perf/tree/inlineMountChildren\r\nTest results: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/59480548\n<issue_comment>username_1: For reference, this separation was introduced intentionally in this PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2567\r\n\r\ncc @username_2\n<issue_comment>username_0: I seem to have broken the test right before pushing. Will investigate.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Yea, this was intentionally separated, knowing that it is a slight performance loss for now. It is a part of an on-going refactor to separate instantiation and resolution from the render strategy. That way we can reuse core React logic while having the option to optimize for different render outputs (DOM, ART, React Native, etc). It is also easier to reason about fragments (components that render multiple elements) if we can diff the resolved set.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to move the instantiation out of the DOM component.\r\n\r\nIt is likely we can remerge this kind of optimization later as more of this refactor starts coming together but I think I'd rather keep it separate for now so that we can incrementally continue the refactor instead of having to make a complete reimplementation from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis brings up an interesting point though. For renderToString, we don't really need to keep any of the internal state tree which is only used for optimizing updates. Maybe we need a whole optimized pipeline that doesn't generate the internal memoization nor the state tree?\n<issue_comment>username_0: :+1: totally agree @username_2. I think that would also help with some of the GC issues we're seeing with higher throughput in node. If you can point me in the right direction for where to start with this, I'd be more than glad to work on it.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Looks like there's still a significant gain if we inline only `ReactChildReconciler.instantiateChildren`:\r\n\r\nChanges: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildren\r\nTest: https://github.com/username_0/react-perf/tree/inlineInstantiateChildren\r\nResult: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/59784288\n<issue_comment>username_1: Nice find. Maybe we can take advantage of ReactChildren.map here? We may want a version which skips the ReactFragment.create call for these internals but otherwise I think it should give the right effect.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I pulled the traversal function out into a named functioned rather than inline in the branch above. I will run a comparison of using `ReactChildren.map` vs `traverseAllChildren` directly.\n<issue_comment>username_0: As you said I'm running into a lot of error logs due to `ReactFragment.create` being called with nulls and other invalid arguments. I think sticking with `traverseAllChildren` in this case will be better.\n<issue_comment>username_1: Sorry, I may have been a little unclear. Can you do something like this\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/src/utils/ReactChildren.js b/src/utils/ReactChildren.js\r\nindex e470609..84ca357 100644\r\n--- a/src/utils/ReactChildren.js\r\n+++ b/src/utils/ReactChildren.js\r\n@@ -122,7 +122,7 @@ function mapChildren(children, func, context) {\r\n   var traverseContext = MapBookKeeping.getPooled(mapResult, func, context);\r\n   traverseAllChildren(children, mapSingleChildIntoContext, traverseContext);\r\n   MapBookKeeping.release(traverseContext);\r\n-  return ReactFragment.create(mapResult);\r\n+  return mapResult;\r\n }\r\n \r\n function forEachSingleChildDummy(traverseContext, child, name, i) {\r\n@@ -142,7 +142,10 @@ function countChildren(children, context) {\r\n \r\n var ReactChildren = {\r\n   forEach: forEachChildren,\r\n-  map: mapChildren,\r\n+  map: function(children, func, context) {\r\n+    return ReactFragment.create(mapChildren(children, func, context));\r\n+  },\r\n+  mapObject: mapChildren,\r\n   count: countChildren\r\n };\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\nand then use ReactChildren.mapObject?\n<issue_comment>username_0: Ok, so I create a branch that uses ReactChildren.mapObject: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildrenWithMap\r\n\r\nThere are two tests that fail using this method:\r\n\r\n * core/__tests__/ReactMultiChildReconcile-test ReactMultiChildReconcile should insert non-empty children in middle where nulls were.\r\n * core/__tests__/ReactMultiChildText-test ReactMultiChildText should correctly handle all possible children for render and update.\r\n\r\nI believe this is because map doesn't handle skipping nulls.\r\n\r\nI also ran a benchmark for using `traverseAllChilden` as my per previous comment vs. using `ReactChildren.mapObject` as @username_1 suggested. Running locally, I'm seeing a significant overhead in using the pooling added by `ReactChildren.mapObject`. On some runs it shows to be less performant than not inlining. You can see the travis-ci run of the benchmark here: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/60283471\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Can you elaborate one what you mean by \"internal state tree\"? I'm trying to understand what could be removed from the rendering path to optimize server rendering. I have a feeling some of the `mountComponent` logic needs to be split up into rendering logic and other logic (event registration, state management, etc.), but I'm not familiar enough with the \"other\" logic that's happening to know what to look at.\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 Interesting. If inlining a closure (like https://gist.github.com/username_1/594910785229dba07d5c) is faster we should probably switch to that – we've tried to avoid closures in favor of manually passing context objects in hopes of lowering GC pressure and improving perf but all of this feels like dogscience.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6820/7360334/68f64cd2-ecfe-11e4-8e6e-b85703c9a2de.png)\n<issue_comment>username_1: Sorry for all the back and forth.\n<issue_comment>username_0: No worries. I too often feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nI think using `traverseAllChildren` directly as in https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildren addresses your concern about GC although it does duplicate some of the code in `ReactChildren.map`. We do need [this check](https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildren#diff-89f33512519fa4d853463913eac8ef04R24) though in order for the tests to pass. Any ideas on introducing that check in to `ReactChildren.map`?\n<issue_comment>username_1: I tried to replicate these results locally and in different browsers. Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git checkout origin/inlineMountChildren\r\n$ npm install -g browserify\r\n$ npm install babelify envify\r\n$ NODE_ENV=production browserify -t babelify bench-chat.js >bundle.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I created bench.html:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<body style=\"font: 10px Menlo; white-space: pre;\">\r\n<div id=\"container\"></div>\r\n<script>\r\nconsole.log = function(x) {\r\n  container.textContent += x.replace(/\\033\\[[0-9;]*m/g, '') + '\\n';\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n<script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpening bench.html in Safari (JavaScriptCore) gave me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderChat for inputs Optimized x 2,094 ops/sec ±0.85% (66 runs sampled)\r\nRenderChat for inputs Stock x 2,081 ops/sec ±0.78% (66 runs sampled)\r\nThe Fastest test suite is RenderChat for inputs Optimized,RenderChat for inputs Stock\r\n\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n|            â”‚ Optimized     â”‚ Stock         |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n| RenderChat â”‚ 2,094 ops/sec â”‚ 2,081 ops/sec |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere they're the same speed (not sure what's up with the encoding there), and in Chrome I got:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderChat for inputs Optimized x 1,534 ops/sec ±2.38% (61 runs sampled)\r\nRenderChat for inputs Stock x 1,775 ops/sec ±1.56% (65 runs sampled)\r\nThe Fastest test suite is RenderChat for inputs Stock\r\n\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n|            │ Optimized     │ Stock         |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n| RenderChat │ 1,534 ops/sec │ 1,775 ops/sec |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the old version is 15% faster.

Any ideas if I'm doing something wrong or if this is just wildly different between engines? I'd have expected Chrome and Node to be more similar, at the very least.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Are the symlinks working correctly for you? browserify does not work for me locally to create the bundle.js as you did. I'm not sure why your results are so different from my local tests and travis-ci.\n<issue_comment>username_0: It's also worth noting, that even with two versions of stock flux, the benchmark for the item that is tested first is usually ~5% lower than the second which is why I moved \"optimized\" as the first test case. Consistency seems to be a consistent problem =/\n<issue_comment>username_0: Here's travis with 10 runs of bench-chat: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/60620846\n<issue_comment>username_0: So it looks like I didn't have the node_modules for each of the apps pushed, so the components may have been using the wrong React. I have pushed the node_modules folder for each app and used symlinks to the react versions such that they are completely isolated. I'm hoping this will make the tests more consistent for you.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/username_0/react-perf/tree/inlineMountChildren\n<issue_comment>username_0: Closing this since it undoes a purposeful refactor.

This inlines those calls as it is a critical rendering path. Through testing a chat example I have found about a 10-15% performance gains through benchmark.js.\r\n\r\nTest: https://github.com/username_0/react-perf/tree/inlineMountChildren\r\nTest results: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/59480548\n<issue_comment>username_1: For reference, this separation was introduced intentionally in this PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2567\r\n\r\ncc @username_2\n<issue_comment>username_0: I seem to have broken the test right before pushing. Will investigate.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Yea, this was intentionally separated, knowing that it is a slight performance loss for now. It is a part of an on-going refactor to separate instantiation and resolution from the render strategy. That way we can reuse core React logic while having the option to optimize for different render outputs (DOM, ART, React Native, etc). It is also easier to reason about fragments (components that render multiple elements) if we can diff the resolved set.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to move the instantiation out of the DOM component.\r\n\r\nIt is likely we can remerge this kind of optimization later as more of this refactor starts coming together but I think I'd rather keep it separate for now so that we can incrementally continue the refactor instead of having to make a complete reimplementation from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis brings up an interesting point though. For renderToString, we don't really need to keep any of the internal state tree which is only used for optimizing updates. Maybe we need a whole optimized pipeline that doesn't generate the internal memoization nor the state tree?\n<issue_comment>username_0: :+1: totally agree @username_2. I think that would also help with some of the GC issues we're seeing with higher throughput in node. If you can point me in the right direction for where to start with this, I'd be more than glad to work on it.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Looks like there's still a significant gain if we inline only `ReactChildReconciler.instantiateChildren`:\r\n\r\nChanges: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildren\r\nTest: https://github.com/username_0/react-perf/tree/inlineInstantiateChildren\r\nResult: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/59784288\n<issue_comment>username_1: Nice find. Maybe we can take advantage of ReactChildren.map here? We may want a version which skips the ReactFragment.create call for these internals but otherwise I think it should give the right effect.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I pulled the traversal function out into a named functioned rather than inline in the branch above. I will run a comparison of using `ReactChildren.map` vs `traverseAllChildren` directly.\n<issue_comment>username_0: As you said I'm running into a lot of error logs due to `ReactFragment.create` being called with nulls and other invalid arguments. I think sticking with `traverseAllChildren` in this case will be better.\n<issue_comment>username_1: Sorry, I may have been a little unclear. Can you do something like this\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/src/utils/ReactChildren.js b/src/utils/ReactChildren.js\r\nindex e470609..84ca357 100644\r\n--- a/src/utils/ReactChildren.js\r\n+++ b/src/utils/ReactChildren.js\r\n@@ -122,7 +122,7 @@ function mapChildren(children, func, context) {\r\n   var traverseContext = MapBookKeeping.getPooled(mapResult, func, context);\r\n   traverseAllChildren(children, mapSingleChildIntoContext, traverseContext);\r\n   MapBookKeeping.release(traverseContext);\r\n-  return ReactFragment.create(mapResult);\r\n+  return mapResult;\r\n }\r\n \r\n function forEachSingleChildDummy(traverseContext, child, name, i) {\r\n@@ -142,7 +142,10 @@ function countChildren(children, context) {\r\n \r\n var ReactChildren = {\r\n   forEach: forEachChildren,\r\n-  map: mapChildren,\r\n+  map: function(children, func, context) {\r\n+    return ReactFragment.create(mapChildren(children, func, context));\r\n+  },\r\n+  mapObject: mapChildren,\r\n   count: countChildren\r\n };\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\nand then use ReactChildren.mapObject?\n<issue_comment>username_0: Ok, so I create a branch that uses ReactChildren.mapObject: https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildrenWithMap\r\n\r\nThere are two tests that fail using this method:\r\n\r\n * core/__tests__/ReactMultiChildReconcile-test ReactMultiChildReconcile should insert non-empty children in middle where nulls were.\r\n * core/__tests__/ReactMultiChildText-test ReactMultiChildText should correctly handle all possible children for render and update.\r\n\r\nI believe this is because map doesn't handle skipping nulls.\r\n\r\nI also ran a benchmark for using `traverseAllChilden` as my per previous comment vs. using `ReactChildren.mapObject` as @username_1 suggested. Running locally, I'm seeing a significant overhead in using the pooling added by `ReactChildren.mapObject`. On some runs it shows to be less performant than not inlining. You can see the travis-ci run of the benchmark here: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/60283471\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Can you elaborate one what you mean by \"internal state tree\"? I'm trying to understand what could be removed from the rendering path to optimize server rendering. I have a feeling some of the `mountComponent` logic needs to be split up into rendering logic and other logic (event registration, state management, etc.), but I'm not familiar enough with the \"other\" logic that's happening to know what to look at.\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 Interesting. If inlining a closure (like https://gist.github.com/username_1/594910785229dba07d5c) is faster we should probably switch to that – we've tried to avoid closures in favor of manually passing context objects in hopes of lowering GC pressure and improving perf but all of this feels like dogscience.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6820/7360334/68f64cd2-ecfe-11e4-8e6e-b85703c9a2de.png)\n<issue_comment>username_1: Sorry for all the back and forth.\n<issue_comment>username_0: No worries. I too often feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nI think using `traverseAllChildren` directly as in https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildren addresses your concern about GC although it does duplicate some of the code in `ReactChildren.map`. We do need [this check](https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/master...username_0:inlineInstantiateChildren#diff-89f33512519fa4d853463913eac8ef04R24) though in order for the tests to pass. Any ideas on introducing that check in to `ReactChildren.map`?\n<issue_comment>username_1: I tried to replicate these results locally and in different browsers. Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git checkout origin/inlineMountChildren\r\n$ npm install -g browserify\r\n$ npm install babelify envify\r\n$ NODE_ENV=production browserify -t babelify bench-chat.js >bundle.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I created bench.html:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<body style=\"font: 10px Menlo; white-space: pre;\">\r\n<div id=\"container\"></div>\r\n<script>\r\nconsole.log = function(x) {\r\n  container.textContent += x.replace(/\\033\\[[0-9;]*m/g, '') + '\\n';\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n<script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpening bench.html in Safari (JavaScriptCore) gave me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderChat for inputs Optimized x 2,094 ops/sec ±0.85% (66 runs sampled)\r\nRenderChat for inputs Stock x 2,081 ops/sec ±0.78% (66 runs sampled)\r\nThe Fastest test suite is RenderChat for inputs Optimized,RenderChat for inputs Stock\r\n\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n|            â”‚ Optimized     â”‚ Stock         |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n| RenderChat â”‚ 2,094 ops/sec â”‚ 2,081 ops/sec |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere they're the same speed (not sure what's up with the encoding there), and in Chrome I got:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderChat for inputs Optimized x 1,534 ops/sec ±2.38% (61 runs sampled)\r\nRenderChat for inputs Stock x 1,775 ops/sec ±1.56% (65 runs sampled)\r\nThe Fastest test suite is RenderChat for inputs Stock\r\n\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n|            │ Optimized     │ Stock         |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n| RenderChat │ 1,534 ops/sec │ 1,775 ops/sec |\r\n+------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the old version is 15% faster. Running `node bench-chat.js` gave me\r\n\r\n```\r\nRenderChat for inputs Optimized x 368 ops/sec ±3.18% (73 runs sampled)\r\nRenderChat for inputs Stock x 348 ops/sec ±2.99% (72 runs sampled)\r\nThe Fastest test suite is RenderChat for inputs Optimized\r\n\r\n+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n|            │ Optimized   │ Stock       |\r\n+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n| RenderChat │ 368 ops/sec │ 348 ops/sec |\r\n+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere your version is maybe 5% faster, but not the 10–15% you were seeing originally. Any ideas if I'm doing something wrong or if this is just wildly different between engines? I'd have expected Chrome and Node to be more similar, at the very least.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Are the symlinks working correctly for you? browserify does not work for me locally to create the bundle.js as you did. I'm not sure why your results are so different from my local tests and travis-ci.\n<issue_comment>username_0: It's also worth noting, that even with two versions of stock flux, the benchmark for the item that is tested first is usually ~5% lower than the second which is why I moved \"optimized\" as the first test case. Consistency seems to be a consistent problem =/\n<issue_comment>username_0: Here's travis with 10 runs of bench-chat: https://travis-ci.org/username_0/react-perf/builds/60620846\n<issue_comment>username_0: So it looks like I didn't have the node_modules for each of the apps pushed, so the components may have been using the wrong React. I have pushed the node_modules folder for each app and used symlinks to the react versions such that they are completely isolated. I'm hoping this will make the tests more consistent for you.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/username_0/react-perf/tree/inlineMountChildren\n<issue_comment>username_0: Closing this since it undoes a purposeful refactor.

I suggest adding `torch.eye_like` that will create a nXn matrix with same number of samples in batch as another tensor.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\neye matrices is widely used in various fields, and creating this short alias can unify its creation, by keeping the same batch, type and device as the given tensor.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n`def eyes_like(x: torch.Tensor, n: int) -> torch.Tensor:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Return a tensor with same batch size as x, that has a nxn eye matrix in each sample in batch.\r\n\r\n    Args:\r\n        x: tensor of shape (B, *).\r\n\r\n    Returns:\r\n        tensor of shape (B, n, n) that has the same dtype and device as x.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return torch.eye(n, n, dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device).unsqueeze(0).repeat(x.shape[0], 1,

During model serialization, we create a unique tag for each source\nrange of the model.\n2. Create a map of <SourceRange, tag>\n3. During debug_pkl serialization we save tag along with SourceRange, on\ntop of byte offset.\n4. During bytecode generation, the methods of the top module are\nlowered. During this process methods are inlined. In the inlined graph,\nwhen the node of a graph is lowered to bytecode, we query node's source\nrange and look it up against the map.\n5. Resulting source range tag is serialized in module_debug_info.\n6. During model deserialization, we read all the debug_pkl records in\nthe archieve and create a map of <tag, SourceRange>\n7. This map can be used to find source code information.\n\nDuring mobile runtime:\n1. We read all the debug_pkl records and create <tag=debug_handle,\nSourceRange> map.\n   1.1 This map, MobileDebugInfo, is a member of mobile Module.\n2. Interpreter catches appropriate exceptions and sets the thread local\ndebug handle and rethrows the exception.\n3. In Function's run method we catch exception and query current debug\nhandle where the exception happened.\n4. Query MobileDebugInfo with debug handle to retrieve source range and\naugment error with source range info.\n\nThis information is still incomplete as it does not contain entire\ncallstack.\n\nIn the following diffs we will serialize InlinedCallStack directly.\n\nNote that compilation is gated by SYMBOLICATE_MOBILE_DEBUG_HANDLE macro,\nso that mobile builds can avoid building MobileDebugInfo, source range\nand source range pickler/unpickler. Later we will add path where, if\nbuilding without debug support stack trace will contain only debug\nhandles. They can be symbolicated later.\n\nTest Plan:\nPorted bunch of source range tests from test_jit.py. Added on more test\nin test_lite_interpreter.py\n\nReviewers:\n\nSubscribers:\n\nTasks:\n\nTags:\n<issue_comment>username_1: Thanks @username_0 \r\n\r\nYour description makes sense, but just to summarize our and clarify a few items.\r\n\r\n**Serialize data**\r\nThe debug information for lite interpreter will consist of 3 artifacts:\r\n1. <SourceRange, Tag> map, where:\r\n1.a SourceRange - associates a node's of the computation graph to its location in the original python source code.\r\n1.b Tag - uniquely identifies the SourceRange (maybe ID would have been a better name?)\r\n1.c This is stored in debug_pkl.\r\n1.d This data (debug_pkl) is optional to include in model or not.\r\n1.e This is loaded in the lite interpreter to recreate the inverse map.\r\n\r\n2. Each statement will have the unique Tag associated to it and serialized with it, corresponding to its SourceRange.\r\n2. a Since the Tag is always going to be added (correct?), efficiency matters (numeric, int32 sounds good).\r\n\r\n3. Call stack data.\r\n3.a Not part of this diff.\r\n3.b Also meant to be optional to include in model or not.\r\n\r\n**Runtime behavior**\r\n1. debug_pkl gets deserialized to produce a map <Tag, SourceRange> (aka MobileDebugInfo)\r\n2. On exception we obtain the Tag associated with the failing statement, look for its SourceRange and add it to the exception data (and in the future will add call stack info as well). \r\n\r\n**Questions / notes:**\r\n1.a  Question: \"node of the computation graph\" maps to a statement in bytecode, correct? If not we should clarify, but meanwhile I'll just refer to \"node\" as \"statement\" since we serialize bytecode not the graph per se.\r\n\r\n1.c The mapping to a Tag being new, introduced in this PR.\r\n\r\n1.e Perhaps silly question, are we really storing them in inverse form?\r\n\r\n2. In the future, do we plan to use a new exception type?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nI'm going through the code in more detail.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Yes. The next step after this PR is: 1. Serialize inlined call stack ptr and use that directly 2. Move to new exception type.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Adding @eellison  as reviewer, who is knowledgable about the serialization format.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 so here I think we will break BC as blast radius seems small. I dont think this is being used very much, internally at least. For longer term we may have to figure out versioning on debug info serialization.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @dreiss I had not considered that. But compiled source code is what gets saved in the code files for TS models. So in theory having tuple(byte_offset, source_range_tag, source range), in .debug_pkl, should also allow us to build a map of source_range_tag-to-byte-offset. This can then give us the byte offset in the transformed/compiled code.  Is that what you meant?\n<issue_comment>username_1: @dreiss \r\n\"I think having a sentinel value is valuable.\"\r\nHaving a sentinel value for a field that's always meant to be present, except for old models that do not have debug handles seems could be achieved in a cleaner way (particularly if we're going as far as using 64b for the field); but since right now we don't do model level decision based on this field I don't feel strongly about it.\r\n\r\nActually, my main question @username_0 is whether we see a case where debug handles may have valid values along with -1 in them. Then I completely agree a flag (sentinel) at the instruction level is necessary.\n<issue_comment>username_0: So at the moment, I dont see a usecase where have -1 as debug handle. David brought up a point about why top level module's type name had to be passed in for symbolication. Can that not be serialized as well? And I was thinking, as I said in my comment, whether we can use some special debug handle that contain top level class's type name.\r\nBesides that nothing else comes to mind

Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9.

from [ghstack](https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack):\n* (to be filled)\n\nThis PR fixes a subtle issue with the finalizer implementation of `_PeriodicTimer`.\n\nWe avoid using a regular finalizer (a.k.a. `__del__`) for stopping the timer as joining a daemon thread during the interpreter shutdown can cause deadlocks. The `weakref.finalize` is a superior alternative that provides a consistent behavior regardless of the GC implementation.\n\nDifferential Revision: [D27889289](https://our.internmc.facebook.com/intern/diff/D27889289/)","issue_id":863241380,"issue_number":56532,"timestamp":"2021-04-20T21:05:09","chunk_id":"d9f5173126f9ff0bb34744335aaa424d"}}

This is done using template expansion since the types are all known at build time.\n\nThis results in generated code that is practically unused.\n\nDifferential Revision: [D25521462](https://our.internmc.facebook.com/intern/diff/D25521462/)\n<issue_comment>username_1: This might work right now but will break when we start using backend fallbacks for things. Not sure if we should land this. We're considering backend fallbacks for some things that are relevant for mobile too, say Variable kernels.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 Thanks for the additional context! The savings are in the range of 37KiB-59KiB depending which app you look at, so not life changing, but we are entering the stage of long tail of small size improvements (@username_2 's note about efficiency resonates with size work too). That said, if this will cause some problems for future work, there's no reason to land it. Will revisit when the backend fallback work is under way/landed.\n<issue_comment>username_1: This would be relatively easy to revert once we start using backend fallbacks. I'm not strongly opposed to landing it, I'll leave it up to you. We just should be aware that this is a temporary win and we will likely have to revert it with the backend fallback work.\n<issue_comment>username_2: This is fine, but I'd like a Note saying why the

Overwrite batched updates with the following code: `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates = callback => callback()`\r\n2. Batched updates aren't actually overwritten.\r\n\r\n## Reasoning\r\n\r\nI recognize that this may not be classified as bug because it isn't a documented feature but I have tried to search for a different solution but to no avail. Fixing this behavior can open a new way of using React. I tried writing on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60852219/disable-unstable-batchedupdates-on-event-handlers-in-react) and writing to [@username_1](https://twitter.com/antoniostoilkov/status/1242789762307588097).\r\n\r\nI have a number of arguments which support the disabling of batched updates in event handlers and in effects initialization. If anybody is willing to read a document and consider this scenario I am willing to write an RFC.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I started wondering if [RFCs for changes to React](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs) isn't a better place to write this issue. Let me know if you agree and I will close this one and write one there.\n<issue_comment>username_1: If anything, we are going to _batch more_ by default, not batch less. Batching is important for multiple reasons, including drastically improving performance for bubbling events, and to avoid inconsistent trees.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make a specific call unbatched, you can do this manually:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.flushSync(() => {\r\n  // this setState won't be batched\r\n  setState(something)\r\n})\r\n```<issue_closed>\n<issue_comment>username_0: Is there a way to apply `flushSync()` to every event handler? I can provide a custom `useLayoutEffect()` and `useEffect()` functions but it is harder with event handlers.\r\n\r\nWe constantly observe bugs caused by the same code behaving differently in two places because at one place batching is happening and at the other, it isn't. I am not saying disabling batching by default, I believe in general this is better for most projects but I can clearly see that in our project it is introducing bugs for the past year. This is strange because our software is almost bug-free. However, batching is probably our biggest contributor to bugs right now.\n<issue_comment>username_1: This is interesting. This behavior has been there for over five years, and this is the first time I'm hearing this worded so strongly. (Usually people learn about batching once, learn not to read from `this.state`, and call it a day.) So I'm curious if there are particular patterns that cause this to be an issue for you.\r\n\r\nIf it's the inconsistency that gets you, you could apply `batchedUpdates` in more places instead. In a future version of React, this will be the default behavior for everything so the inconsistency will go away.\n<issue_comment>username_1: I guess if you really want to do it, maybe something like this could work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst origSetState = React.Component.prototype.setState\r\nReact.Component.prototype.setState = function(...args) {\r\n  ReactDOM.flushSync(() => {\r\n    origSetState.apply(this, arguments);\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you can probably come up with something similar for Hooks (or use your own `useState` Hook).\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this is terrible for performance and will cause issues both for third-party components and for the future you who will be debugging this.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I am currently writing an example to show you the cases we are hitting and why bugs are appearing. Will get back to you soon.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Here is the example: https://codesandbox.io/s/cranky-sanderson-7kdcx.\r\n\r\nNow let me explain:\r\n1) Clicking \"Log in\" throws an error showing the bug.\r\n1) I know that this example can be fixed by adding `autoFocus` to the input. However, imagine that focusing is conditional and the component doesn't know if it should focus itself when being created. If the new component should be focused is determined from the place that triggers the new component to show so no way to know in the component itself. Adding if the component should be focused as a state property introduces a new set of problems that I can explain if you want.\r\n1) The same happens with any method of the element like `scrollIntoView()` or `getBoundingClientRect()`. For us `focus()` and `scrollIntoView()` are the most common. Mainly `focus()`.\r\n1) I understand this is a domain-specific problem because our application is shortcut-heavy and manages focus very strictly. I can even show you the app and give you 4-5 bugs that were caused by that behavior.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that `inputRef.current` in the `onClick()` handler will have a different value depending on batched updates being used or not.\r\n\r\nNote that if you can't understand what are the use cases of having access to a ref after updating the state I can go into bigger details and real-world use cases in our app.\r\n\r\nI hope that you understood me. Let me emphasize that our app manages focus a lot and React isn't good at handling focus. Maybe if a good solution for focusing exists this kind of problems can be fixed with an abstraction and not by disabling batched updates but until then I have tried many things and haven't found a solution.\n<issue_comment>username_0: By the way, using `flushSync()` we can do something else and avoid disabling batched updates directly. We have methods that change the state and we can wrap all of them with `flushSync()`. I am describing everything above in order to help you understand a set of use cases that I believe are valid. I hope I will be helpful because for me it is a little strange I didn't found anybody talking about this problem.\n<issue_comment>username_1: That's a good callout. It's fair to say React doesn't really give you the tools to do it very well. We've been doing some work in that area but it's behind an experimental flag and is not ready to be a stable API yet. This is definitely something that's on our minds but we won't have a solution in the very near future.\r\n\r\nIn class-based code, you could do this to work around the problem:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsetState({ isVisible: true }, () => {\r\n  this.inputRef.curent.focus()\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's the idiomatic workaround in classes. We don't (yet?) have something similar exposed for Hooks because that exact API won't work. In particular, it would \"see\" old props and state which would be highly confusing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in function components the only way you can get \"notified\" about commits is with `useLayoutEffect`. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n    if (isTwoFactorAuthenticationVisible) {\r\n      inputRef.current.focus();\r\n    }\r\n  }, [isTwoFactorAuthenticationVisible]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would solve your problem: https://codesandbox.io/s/laughing-fast-9785u.\r\n\r\nHowever, I agree this solution isn't ideal because the desire to focus might in some cases have more to do with *which action triggered it* rather than *which state changed*.\r\n\r\nI think there are at least two opportunities for RFC design here:\r\n\r\n- More intuitive and declarative focus management that works within the React paradigm. (There was some work on this here: https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/109, although I don't think this necessarily addresses your concerns. Maybe you could comment on it.)\r\n- A way to express \"run some side effect after a particular setState is flushed\". We have this for classes, but not for Hooks. It seems like a useful feature. But it's not clear what the design should be like. So working on that would also be beneficial.\r\n\r\nI don't think the solution is to \"revert back\" to a paradigm where each setState is atomic. We think this would be a regression. Instead, we think this needs to be \"fixed forward\" by finding the right abstractions that work with the React model. In the meantime, I hope the workarounds above are reasonable.\n<issue_comment>username_1: React version: 16.9.5\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Overwrite batched updates with the following code: `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates = callback => callback()`\r\n2. Batched updates aren't actually overwritten.\r\n\r\n## Reasoning\r\n\r\nI recognize that this may not be classified as bug because it isn't a documented feature but I have tried to search for a different solution but to no avail.

If anybody is willing to read a document and consider this scenario I am willing to write an RFC.\n<issue_comment>username_1: I reopened this for discussion with a different title.\n<issue_comment>username_1: Here's a small abstraction you could build in userland today:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  const perform = useCommand(command => {\r\n    if (command === \"focusInput\") {\r\n      inputRef.current.focus();\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  setState(...)\r\n  perform(\"focusInput');\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/blissful-elgamal-umn3p\r\n\r\nIn this example, `useCommand` maintains an internal queue of commands to run at the commit time. You can schedule more of them by calling `perform` returned to it. The commands are guaranteed to run in the commit phase and each runs only once.\r\n\r\nDon't know if this is sufficient for this use case but maybe at least for a subset?\n<issue_comment>username_1: cc @sophiebits I think you had something similar for `useEffect`\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 Can you tell me more about your use cases that *don't* have to do with focus? You mentioned measurements. Some simplified but relatively realistic code would help here.\n<issue_comment>username_0: - `flushSync()` works, I will definitely experiment with it.\r\n- `this.setState()` doesn't because our codebase is written with Hooks.\r\n- The `useLayoutEffect()` isn't ideal as you described. In our app, exactly which action triggered the show matters.\r\n- `useCommand()` – very interesting, let me sleep on it, I think it is a good alternative.\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example not related to focus. I will describe it as making a code example will be complicated. BTW if you don't understand the example I can make a GIF showcasing the use case in our app.\r\n- We have a Files Sidebar which shows the files of the project. Just like any modern code editor.\r\n- Our app by default has an auto reveal feature. Just like VSCode `Explorer: Auto Reveal` option. Opening a file scrolls to it in the Files Sidebar using `element.scrollIntoView()`.\r\n- Now imagine you have `folderA/fileA.md` and `folderB/fileB.md`. You move from `fileA` to `fileB`. The Files Sidebar hasn't still rendered `fileB.md` and should wait for the render to happen in order to call `scrollIntoView()`.\r\n- This call to `scrollIntoView()` happens only when opening files but not at other times. Exactly as you said – which action was triggered matters.\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction openTab() {\r\n  // call Redux or other global store for changing the file state\r\n\r\n  // access the Files Sidebar ref to the fileB item and call `scrollIntoView()`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding the RFC: I read it few months ago when I was struggling with finding a good implementation for calling `focus()` from one component into another. It indeed doesn't solve this problem but I will go through it again and see if I can point to this issue as a reference describing that it can be worth considering it.\r\n\r\nI agree the solution isn't to revert back.\r\n\r\nYour comments made me think. I will reflect on our conversation and I will write here again.\r\n\r\nThank you for the time spent considering this.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I can share a solution I was playing a few months ago which solves this problem. I called it next render. If you can't figure out how I did it and you are interested I can write a more detailed explanation:\r\n```typescript\r\n// App.tsx\r\n<NextRender>\r\n\t<App />\r\n</NextRender>\r\n\r\n// Component.tsx\r\nconst nextRender = useNextRender()\r\n\r\nfunction openTab() {\r\n  // change state\r\n\r\n  nextRender(() => {\r\n\t// focus here\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_0: https://codesandbox.io/s/objective-rgb-lb0cu\r\n\r\nI made a new example so we can discuss a more real-world scenario. Our app has global shortcuts for opening tabs. Opening a tab should focus the editor. How do we focus the newly created editor? After we know how to do it, how do we make it work when batching updates?\r\n\r\nI am aware that we can again use `autoFocus` or `useLayoutEffect()` but this focusing when the editor is created is optional in our app and depends on the reason why the tab will be opened – previewing a file or opening it for edits.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I started understanding why you wanted me to give you an example for getting measurements. Because `getBoundingClientRect()` returns a value which you then want to use and your `useCommand()` idea won't work then.\r\n\r\nWe don't have an example with `getBoundingClientRect()` or anything that returns a value in our app. I can imagine a theoretical example – but I don't like those, we should look at real-world examples.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction openTab() {\r\n  // change state\r\n\r\n  // this is harder\r\n  const rect = elementRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be solved with a similar technique to `useCommand()` it just needs a little different API:\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction openTab() {\r\n  // change state\r\n\r\n  nextLayoutEffect(() => \r\n    const rect = elementRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_1: We chatted about this with @sebmarkbage and he noticed these examples tend to be similar to our internal notion of “update queues”. So maybe that’s something we could expose as a lower level concept.\r\n\r\nIt seems like they often have a particular thing in common: you want “the last one to win”. For example:\r\n\r\n* If multiple things call focus, you want only the last one to win.\r\n\r\n* If multiple things call scrollIntoView, you want the last one to win.\r\n\r\nHowever these queues are separate. You don’t want scrollIntoView to “overwrite” the focus operation.\r\n\r\nNote that declarative attributes like autoFocus suffers from a flaw where instead of the last operation winning, we have the last sibling winning. That doesn’t really make sense. It’s the last operation that matters.\r\n\r\nWe were thinking there could be:\r\n\r\n```js \r\nimport { queueFocus } from ‘react-dom'\r\n\r\nconst onClick = () => {\r\n  queueFocus(inputRef)\r\n  setState()\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote we’re passing the *ref itself*. So it doesn’t matter that React hasn’t set it yet. It will read from mutable object when the time comes. \r\n\r\nIf it’s a more generic concept that’s not limited to focus then it could get more powerful. But also more verbose.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// singleton\r\nexport const useScrollQueue = createEffectQueue()\r\nexport const useFocusQueue = createEffectQueue()\r\n\r\n// app\r\nimport { useFocusQueue } from 'somewhere'\r\n\r\n// ...\r\nconst queueFocus = useFocusQueue()\r\n\r\nconst onClick = () => {\r\n  queueFocus(inputRef)\r\n  setState()\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough then the question becomes where do we keep those queues and how to get third party components to agree on using them. So perhaps they should be built-in after all.\r\n\r\nThis is why we want to understand the full breadth of the use cases. Are they all “fire and forget”, are they all “last one wins”, and how many common distinct ones there are.\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be an RFC.\n<issue_comment>username_1: With focus specifically @trueadm said there’s even more pitfalls. That there are cases to consider about blur event handlers causing other focus, or focus causing other focus. Cascading effects. And that sometimes the browser needs to paint first. I don’t have all the background knowledge to talk about this but it’s something you would need to research if you plan to write an RFC.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Hmm...does `scrollIntoView()` last call wins? Imagine two scrollable containers with `overflow: scroll;` set to them. They both can take calls and scroll individually.\r\n\r\nI have some ideas for solutions. Give me some time to implement and think about them.\n<issue_comment>username_0: I haven't tested this fully but what do you think about this:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { useMemo, MutableRefObject, useRef, useCallback } from 'react'\r\nimport useForceUpdate from 'use-force-update'\r\n\r\nexport default function useElementRef<T extends HTMLElement | null>(): MutableRefObject<T> & {\r\n  queueFocus(): void\r\n  queueScrollIntoView(arg?: boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions | undefined): void\r\n} {\r\n  const nextLayoutEffect = useNextLayoutEffect()\r\n  const value = useMemo(() => {\r\n    const callback: MutableRefObject<T> & {\r\n      queueFocus(): void\r\n      queueScrollIntoView(arg?: boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions | undefined): void\r\n    } = (element: T): void => {\r\n      callback.current = element\r\n    }\r\n    callback.current = null!\r\n    callback.queueFocus = (): void => {\r\n      nextLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n        callback.current?.focus()\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    callback.queueScrollIntoView = (arg?: boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions): void => {\r\n      nextLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n        callback.current?.scrollIntoView(arg)\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return callback\r\n  }, [nextLayoutEffect])\r\n\r\n  return value\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction useNextLayoutEffect(): (callback: () => void) => void {\r\n  const callbacks = useRef<(() => void)[]>([])\r\n  const forceUpdate = useForceUpdate()\r\n\r\n  return useCallback(\r\n    (callback: () => void) => {\r\n      callbacks.current.push(callback)\r\n      forceUpdate()\r\n    },\r\n    [forceUpdate],\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst inputRef = useElementRef()\r\n\r\nfunction openTab() {\r\n  // change state\r\n\r\n  inputRef.queueFocus()\r\n}\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_1: That's a good point!\n<issue_comment>username_0: I want to explain why I am searching for alternatives to `useFocusQueue()`. If the developer doesn't understand this problem they will as usual without researching call `ref.current.focus()`. Even if they know about `useFocusQueue()` there are still two problems:\r\n- Wh will you use it instead of `.focus()`? You don't understand the reason, you don't use it.\r\n- How you don't forget about using it? How a developer unfamiliar with the problem know to use it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my solution doesn't solve these problems. It solves two smaller problems:\r\n- Using TypeScript I can `Omit<HTMLElement, 'focus'>` and the compiler will complain when you try to call `focus()`.\r\n- Set a standard for using `useElementRef()` for elements ref which will make it one step easier to try to call `focus()`, fail and then see the `queueFocus()` method.\n<issue_comment>username_1: ESLint can help here. Same as with other patterns that aren't recommended.\n<issue_comment>username_0: ```javascript\r\n'no-restricted-syntax': [\r\n  'error',\r\n  {\r\n    selector: 'MemberExpression[property.name=\"focus\"][object.property.name=\"current\"]',\r\n    message: `Don't call focus() directly on an element. Use queueFocus() instead.`,\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_0: Based on our discussion I wrote a document outlining the benefits and disadvantages of all the possible solutions you and I came up with. Based on that document I implemented one of the solutions in our project (a variation of the things we have discussed).\r\n\r\nIf the experiment is stable for some period of time I will post the solution here.\n<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 I wanted to follow up on this discussion, how did your experiment turn out? Would you mind to share that document here so we can all learn from your experience?\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Yes. We have been testing the solution in our production app for a few months and everything looks great. I am working on an open-source repo and will share it when it's done(2-3 weeks from now).\n<issue_comment>username_0: Here is the solution we have been using in production for a few months without it causing a single bug – https://gist.github.com/username_0/5d7b493634586a48d2f1c336349af9d8.\r\n\r\nI tried to open-source a repo but there are a lot of questions I will need to answer first.\r\n\r\nP.S. The gist doesn't provide implementations for `queueSelect()` and `queueScrollIntoView()` but if @username_1 likes the `queueFocus()` solution I can update the gist with more information and

version: 16.9.5\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Batched updates aren't actually overwritten.\r\n\r\n## Reasoning\r\n\r\nI recognize that this may not be classified as bug because it isn't a documented feature but I have tried to search for a different solution but to no avail. Fixing this behavior can open a new way of using React. I tried writing on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60852219/disable-unstable-batchedupdates-on-event-handlers-in-react) and writing to [@username_1](https://twitter.com/antoniostoilkov/status/1242789762307588097).\r\n\r\nI have a number of arguments which support the disabling of batched updates in event handlers and in effects initialization. If anybody is willing to read a document and consider this scenario I am willing to write an RFC.","issue_id":589059162,"issue_number":18402,"timestamp":"2020-03-27T11:12:20","chunk_id":"35de5be68127e247f8dc8dff5521ecbd"}}

Try to import pytorch using \"import torch\"\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- Pytorch should be imported without any error-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n - PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): 1.6.0\r\n - OS (e.g., Linux): Windows 10 home 64bit\r\n - How you installed PyTorch (`conda`, `pip`, source): conda\r\n - Build command you used (if compiling from source):\r\n - Python version: 3.8.5\r\n - CUDA/cuDNN version: Cudatoolkit V10.2.89/cuDNN V7.6.5\r\n - GPU models and configuration: RTX 2080 TI\r\n - Any other relevant information:\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- There was an error loading asmjit.dll -->\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 , did you use `conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch` to install pytorch\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 \r\n\r\nI used conda install -c pytorch pytorch and the cuda version that I have was shipped together\n<issue_comment>username_2: Could you please post some logs using Process Monitor or the Debugging Tools for Windows?\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 How do I do that? I'm not quite sure on how to do that and I haven't been able to find instructions on how to do it.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Download process monitor from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon and open it. And then you just do the normal `import torch` in CMD. Finally, just stop monitoring, save it and post the saved file here.<issue_closed>\n<issue_comment>username_0: After running \"import torch\" in CMD, I found out that the latest Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable was not installed on my system. After installing it, I am now able to use pytorch normally. I'll be closing this issue.\n<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 So which environment / IDE are you using previously?\n<issue_comment>username_0: I was using Spyder and Spyder failed to mention anything about the lack of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable other than displaying the aforementioned OsError\n<issue_comment>username_3: Just adding a comment that this was not an IDE-related issue at all. I too faced the issue when updating to and installing afresh 1.6.0 but with plain old Powershell. And I got the error message despite the fact that the 2017 redistributable was already installed in my computer. Of course, now that I installed 2015-2019 version, things seem to be working normally. If this is a separate requirement that's not installable with conda, would it be possible to add that bit of information to the install instructions?\n<issue_comment>username_4: As mentioned earlier, the error can be resolved by installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable.\n<issue_comment>username_5: The error still exists even after installing the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable... \\cry\n<issue_comment>username_6: I use \"conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch\" install pytorch，python version:3.8.5，this error still remain...\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_6 \r\n1. Does the asmjit.dll exist?\r\n2. if asmjit.dll exist, could you please use [depends](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) to see which depends missing?\n<issue_comment>username_7: @username_6 can

I can reproduce in master. cc @username_2\n<issue_comment>username_2: The problem is related to https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/51720.\r\n\r\nThe optimal workspace size for the input of this size is `2.70021e+09` which doesn't fit into `int` type. In PyTorch, we use a 32-bit interface to backend linear algebra libraries.\r\nWe can \"fix\" the internal assert with this patch\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp b/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp\r\nindex 853f5c2cbe..8902958d98 100644\r\n--- a/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp\r\n+++ b/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp\r\n@@ -2984,7 +2984,9 @@ static void apply_svd(Tensor& self, Tensor& U, Tensor& S, Tensor& VT,\r\n   int lwork = -1;\r\n   scalar_t wkopt;\r\n   lapackSvd<scalar_t, value_t>(jobz, m, n, self_data, lda, S_data, U_data, lda, VT_data, ldvt, &wkopt, lwork, rwork_data, iwork_data, &info);\r\n-  lwork = std::max<int>(1, real_impl<scalar_t, value_t>(wkopt));\r\n+  TORCH_CHECK(\r\n+      (real_impl<scalar_t, value_t>(wkopt)) < INT_MAX,\r\n+      \"svd: The optimal workspace size is larger than allowed by 32-bit interface to backend math library.\");\r\n   Tensor work = at::empty({lwork}, self.options());\r\n   auto work_data = work.data_ptr<scalar_t>();\r\n```\r\nThe issue is likely there for other functions as well and we could include checks of the values before casting them to int.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 will there be any way around this in the future for large SVDs? Or is there an upper size limit due to the 32bit interface?\n<issue_comment>username_2: Unfortunately, there is no workaround available.\r\nFrom the MKL documentation the workspace size (`lwork`) can be computed using these guidelines:\r\n```\r\nFor real flavors:\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'N', lwork ≥ 3*min(m, n) + max (max(m,n), 6*min(m, n));\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'O', lwork ≥ 3*(min(m, n))2 + max (max(m, n), 5*(min(m, n))2 + 4*min(m, n));\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'S' or 'A', lwork ≥ 3*(min(m, n))2 + max (max(m, n), 4*(min(m, n))2 + 4*min(m, n))\r\n\r\nFor complex flavors:\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'N', lwork ≥ 2*min(m, n) + max(m, n);\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'O', lwork ≥ 2*(min(m, n))2 + max(m, n) + 2*min(m, n);\r\n\r\nIf jobz = 'S' or 'A', lwork ≥ (min(m, n))2 + max(m, n) + 2*min(m, n);\r\n```\r\n`lwork` must be smaller than `2147483647` (maximum `int`) in order to not hit the limitation of the 32-bit interface.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Any clue as to why `svdvals` and `eigvalsh` work?\n<issue_comment>username_1: For what is worth, `svdvals` and `eigvalsh` may work in master when the input does not require gradients, as we do not compute the `U` and the `Vh` in those cases, so the working space needed is less than for the full SVD /

I am fine with the API authentication, I opted for HAWK in HapiJS. So I can include Hawk credentials in my request header, and fetch data from my API.\r\n\r\nThis is what I want to achieve:\r\n\r\n1. User try to access a route in React Router that required Authentication (No idea how to set it)\r\n2. User is redirected to a Login component that allow Facebook login\r\n3. Upon successful login authentication, Facebook credentials are saved in a database, along with hawk credentials, and stored in a cookie\r\n4. User can now authenticate with the API using credentials in his cookie and fetch data.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know about JWT and HAWK, they are only concerned with step 4.

{"question":{"chain_of_thought":"The issue seems to be related to the rendering performance of large numbers in the application. Formatting the numbers as strings first appears to alleviate the problem. The render time increases disproportionately as more digits are added to the numbers. The issue is exacerbated when dealing with numbers that are not formatted and have 10 or more digits. The example provided with `<span>{123456789.1234}</span>` is enough to slow down the render process.

I'm not quite sure on how to do that and I haven't been able to find instructions on how to do it.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Download process monitor from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon and open it. And then you just do the normal `import torch` in CMD. Finally, just stop monitoring, save it and post the saved file here.<issue_closed>\n<issue_comment>username_0: After running \"import torch\" in CMD, I found out that the latest Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable was not installed on my system. After installing it, I am now able to use pytorch normally. I'll be closing this issue.\n<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 So which environment / IDE are you using previously?\n<issue_comment>username_0: I was using Spyder and Spyder failed to mention anything about the lack of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable other than displaying the aforementioned OsError\n<issue_comment>username_3: Just adding a comment that this was not an IDE-related issue at all. I too faced the issue when updating to and installing afresh 1.6.0 but with plain old Powershell. And I got the error message despite the fact that the 2017 redistributable was already installed in my computer. Of course, now that I installed 2015-2019 version, things seem to be working normally. If this is a separate requirement that's not installable with conda, would it be possible to add that bit of information to the install instructions?\n<issue_comment>username_4: As mentioned earlier, the error can be resolved by installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable.\n<issue_comment>username_5: The error still exists even after installing the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable... \\cry\n<issue_comment>username_6: I use \"conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch\" install pytorch，python version:3.8.5，this error still remain...\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_6 \r\n1. Does the asmjit.dll exist?\r\n2. if asmjit.dll exist, could you please use [depends](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) to see which depends missing?\n<issue_comment>username_7: @username_6 can
