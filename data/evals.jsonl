Check console log\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst Test = props => {\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"useEffect in child\");\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return \"Test useEffect\";\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst App = () => {\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"timeout in render\");\r\n  }, 0);\r\n\r\n  return <Test />;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default App\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\n[Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/amazing-payne-4lmxo)\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nThe message is not the same order;\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n/**\r\n * chrome result\r\n *\r\n * useEffect in child\r\n * timeout in render\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * safari result\r\n *\r\n * timeout in render\r\n * useEffect in child\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe message should be same;\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n/**\r\n * chrome result\r\n *\r\n * useEffect in child\r\n * timeout in render\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * safari result\r\n *\r\n * useEffect in child\r\n * timeout in render\r\n */\r\n```\n<issue_comment>username_1: You do the side effect in the render method:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst App = () => {\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"timeout in render\");\r\n  }, 0);\r\n\r\n  return <Test />;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nwhich is not allowed. React doesn't guarantee this kind of orders. you should put `setTimeout` inside an useEffect.\n<issue_comment>username_0: Yes, i agree this is not allowed. But different browsers should have same result.I think react should achieve lifecycle with more stable browser interfaces.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Many reasons why this is not a bug:\r\n\r\n - you are not allowed to make side effects in render. If you do that, the outcome is essentially \"undefined behaviour\", that is, nothing is guaranteed\r\n\r\n- React provides no guarantees about timing of `useEffect` with respect to render anyway.\r\n\r\nSo while this is an inconsistency and it could be fixed, there is not good reason to do so.\n<issue_comment>username_3: It is not supported to call `setTimeout` during rendering. React provides absolutely no guarantees about the order or the number of component render calls — so you can't rely on subtle timing aspects of them.\r\n\r\nIf I wrap it in `useEffect` I don't observe the difference.<issue_closed>","repo":"facebook/react","issue_id":664173077,"issue_number":19438}

I don't know how easy that is to do. (Maybe this is a reason not to use pybind11, but that ship has kind of sailed...)\n<issue_comment>username_3: If everything works on MSVC with its default option -- that is, no exposure unless explicitly asked to -- could replacing all occurrences of `__declspec(dllexport)` with something also compatible with `gcc` work?

The first time JIT/TorchScript sees an input it will specialize and do optimizations against that input, so when comparing performance please allow a compilation time and runtime optimization warmup for the input.\n<issue_comment>username_4: @username_3 That made a big difference to my traced module too.

JIT fusion does not support in-place operation fusion and reduction operation yet.\r\n2. we did the fusion code generation at the first time we see an input that the shape we haven't seen before (like if the number of dimensions are different), this will help us generate faster cuda kernels. \r\n\r\nSo the TorchScript compilation time will be gone after compile and the first run :)\n<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nI have removed all in-place operations and added three kernel implementations:\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport math\r\nimport torch\r\nimport time\r\nimport random\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\ndef kernel_native(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps):\r\n    # type: (Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, float, float, float, float) -> None\r\n    exp_avg.mul_(beta1).add_(1 - beta1, grad)\r\n    exp_avg_sq.mul_(beta2).addcmul_(1 - beta2, grad, grad)\r\n    denom = exp_avg_sq.sqrt().add_(eps)\r\n    param.addcdiv_(-step_size, exp_avg, denom)   \r\n\r\n@torch.jit.script\r\ndef kernel_jit_script1(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps):\r\n    # type: (Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, float, float, float, float) -> None\r\n    exp_avg *= beta1\r\n    exp_avg += (1 - beta1) + grad\r\n    exp_avg_sq *= beta2\r\n    exp_avg_sq += (1 - beta2)*(grad*grad)\r\n    param += -step_size * (exp_avg / exp_avg_sq.sqrt() + eps)\r\n\r\n@torch.jit.script\r\ndef kernel_jit_script2(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps):\r\n    # type: (Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, float, float, float, float) -> None\r\n    exp_avg[:] = exp_avg * beta1 + (1 - beta1) + grad\r\n    exp_avg_sq[:] = exp_avg_sq * beta2 + (1 - beta2)*(grad*grad)\r\n    param[:] = param -step_size * (exp_avg / exp_avg_sq.sqrt() + eps)\r\n\r\n@torch.jit.script\r\ndef kernel_jit_script3(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps):\r\n    # type: (Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, float, float, float, float) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor]\r\n    exp_avg = exp_avg * beta1 + (1 - beta1) + grad\r\n    exp_avg_sq = exp_avg_sq * beta2 + (1 - beta2)*(grad*grad)\r\n    param = param -step_size * (exp_avg / exp_avg_sq.sqrt() + eps)\r\n    return (param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq)\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom numba import cuda\r\n@cuda.jit\r\ndef kernel_numba_cuda(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps):\r\n    i = cuda.grid(1)\r\n    if i > grad.size:\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    exp_avg[i] = exp_avg[i] * beta1 + (1 - beta1) + grad[i]\r\n    exp_avg_sq[i] = exp_avg_sq[i] * beta2 + (1 - beta2) *grad[i]*grad[i]\r\n    denom = math.sqrt(exp_avg_sq[i]) + eps\r\n    param[i] += -step_size * (exp_avg[i] / denom)\r\n\r\ndef kernel_numba(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps):\r\n    # type: (Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, Tensor, float, float, float, float) -> None\r\n\r\n    import ctypes\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    def get_devicendarray(t):\r\n        assert t.type() == 'torch.cuda.FloatTensor'\r\n        numpy_dtype = np.float32\r\n        itemsize = 4\r\n\r\n        ctx = cuda.cudadrv.driver.driver.get_context()\r\n        mp = cuda.cudadrv.driver.MemoryPointer(ctx, ctypes.c_ulong(t.data_ptr()), t.numel()*itemsize)\r\n        return cuda.cudadrv.devicearray.DeviceNDArray(t.numel(), itemsize, numpy_dtype(), gpu_data=mp, stream=torch.cuda.current_stream().cuda_stream)\r\n\r\n    numba_param = get_devicendarray(param)\r\n    numba_grad = get_devicendarray(grad)\r\n    numba_exp_avg = get_devicendarray(exp_avg)\r\n    numba_exp_avg_sq = get_devicendarray(exp_avg_sq)\r\n    threadsperblock = 32\r\n    blockspergrid = (param.numel() + (threadsperblock - 1)) // threadsperblock\r\n    kernel_numba_cuda[blockspergrid, threadsperblock](numba_param, numba_grad, numba_exp_avg, numba_exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps)\r\n\r\nkernels = [(\"native \", kernel_native), (\"numba  \", kernel_numba)]\r\nshape = (4194304*64,)\r\nparam, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq = [torch.rand(shape).to(\"cuda\") for x in range(4)]\r\n[Truncated]\n        res = func(param, grad, exp_avg, exp_avg_sq, beta1, beta2, step_size, eps)\r\n        if res is not None:\r\n            param[:], _, exp_avg[:], exp_avg_sq[:] = res\r\n        torch.cuda.synchronize()\r\n        t2 = time.time()\r\n        print(\"%s: \" % name, t2-t1)\r\n```\r\nThe results are:\r\n```\r\nnative :  0.0323\r\nnumba  :  0.0147\r\nTScript1:  0.0369\r\nTScript2:  0.0352\r\nTScript3:  0.0280\r\n```\r\nTScript3 is now better than native but still far from numba.

I can take a look on Monday, it's getting a bit late here.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Also, has anyone found a way to show the actual hardware used on the CI in detail?\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 I am working in parallel on a paperspace environment .. it tooks a lot of time it is running with 8 cpu cores.\n<issue_comment>username_2: But have you ever been able to reproduce this issue on paperspace?\n<issue_comment>username_1: I can reproduce it locally: Arch Linux, CUDA 10.0, RTX2070 GPU. Given the CI failures, I think it should be reproducible for multiple CUDA and GPU versions. I just haven't worked on any CUDA code before, and am short on time, so I'd rather not dig too deep.\n<issue_comment>username_0: not yet .. my last building was with a my previous commit ... I will work again in this task in some minutes :)\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 your previous commit had the same failure though (except for the less clear exception message), and it seems quite reproducible. So I think you'll see it now.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Ah, thanks.  @username_0, then I guess just compiling with \"DEBUG=1\" and stepping through the offending code with gdb may be the fastest way.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 thanks! I will try that!\n<issue_comment>username_0: it seems just UpSampleBicubic2d is using upsample_get_value_bounded (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/19630/files#diff-5092da792c30694ee4adf0d0ae2a37c6R171) and upsample_increment_value_bounded (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/19630/files#diff-5092da792c30694ee4adf0d0ae2a37c6R191)\r\n\r\nmaybe the problem could be inside one of these functions ... maybe related to the order of indexes (x, y) ...\r\n\r\nbut the problem seems to be related to cuda block/threads ... so not sure if it is really related to these functions.\n<issue_comment>username_2: The new code uses far more registers than the existing one. I verified that the both versions actually call the offending test case with `1024` in `blockDim`.  So it's very likely a register issue.\r\n\r\n`Existing` uses `64` registers, which seems to be optimal or my card:\r\n\r\n```\r\nptxas info    : 77696 bytes gmem, 72 bytes cmem[3]\r\nptxas info    : Compiling entry function '_Z23bicubic_interp2d_kerneliddb15THCDeviceTensorIdLi4Ei16DefaultPtrTraitsES1_' for 'sm_61'\r\nptxas info    : Function properties for _Z23bicubic_interp2d_kerneliddb15THCDeviceTensorIdLi4Ei16DefaultPtrTraitsES1_\r\n    0 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads\r\nptxas info    : Used 64 registers, 432 bytes cmem[0], 24 bytes cmem[2]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`New` uses `124` registers, which is too much for my card:\r\n\r\n```\r\nptxas info    : 77696 bytes gmem, 72 bytes cmem[3]\r\nptxas info    : Compiling entry function '_ZN2at6native76_GLOBAL__N__52_tmpxft_0000626d_00000000_6_UpSampleBicubic2d_cpp1_ii_b4c1e1f328upsample_bicubic2d_out_frameElddbNS_20PackedTensorAccessorIdLm4ENS_16DefaultPtrTraitsElEES4_' for 'sm_61'\r\nptxas info    : Function properties for _ZN2at6native76_GLOBAL__N__52_tmpxft_0000626d_00000000_6_UpSampleBicubic2d_cpp1_ii_b4c1e1f328upsample_bicubic2d_out_frameElddbNS_20PackedTensorAccessorIdLm4ENS_16DefaultPtrTraitsElEES4_\r\n    0 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads\r\nptxas info    : Used 124 registers, 496 bytes cmem[0], 24 bytes cmem[2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `__launch_bounds__(1024)`, the code again uses `64` registers.\r\n\r\nIf you use `C10_LAUNCH_BOUNDS_1(1024)` **for both kernels**, the tests pass here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow *why* is the regcount higher in the new code? It could be `PackedTensorAccessor`, it could be the fact that many instances of `int` have been changed to `int64_t`. :)\r\n\r\nYou could experiment or just use the launch bounds.  Other code in `native/cuda` seems to use lower bounds for `blockDim`, too.  1024 seems to be an outlier.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 \r\n\r\nit seems it worked locally! thank you so much!

Just want to make sure we have the correct one after porting.\n<issue_comment>username_3: Just as a clarification: I'm OK with having changes which are improvements over the old kernels come in latter patches.\n<issue_comment>username_3: I finished reviewing one of the kernels, and did a cursory scan of the others. In general the patch looks like it's in good shape. I'd suggest that we fix up the major correctness issues (PackedTensorAccessor ref, and int32 versus int64 indexing) and anything small that is easy to fix (for example, double zeroing the array), and leave other improvements for follow ups. Should be ready to land soon!\n<issue_comment>username_0: thanks so much @username_3!\r\nI will let you know when it is ready again for a new review! thanks!\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 @username_3 \r\nnot sure but the errors on CI seems to be related to jenkins ... it seems all these jobs that failed (for building) ran by 01h 01min ... not sure if it is a coincidence ...\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 indeed it looks like all jobs were aborted at the same time. no obvious issues in the build log related to your code. Comparing e.g. the `cuda9-cudnn7` build with a successful one from another PR, it takes 1hr 14min there and your build is about at the place where the other one is after an hour.\r\n\r\nI suggest to just push a new commit to rebuild. Probably a temporary CI hiccup.\n<issue_comment>username_3: I accidentally rebooted Jenkins yesterday which is the likely cause, my apologies.\r\n\r\n@pytorchbot retest this please\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 @username_2 @username_1 \r\n\r\nall tests passed except `pr/caffe2-py2-cuda9.0-cudnn7-windows-build`:\r\n \r\n```\r\n14:43:49 Build timed out (after 180 minutes).

It didn't timeout while running a relevant test, so I judge it to be not your problem.\n<issue_comment>username_3: The launch bounds logic is wrong, but I acknowledge that this is a big patch already; just fix it in a follow up.

Can you suggest a workaround?\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 You can try to put debug statements in CycleGAN code and see which one isn't supported by your CPU (probably some PIL operations), and search for replacements.

Given the CI failures, I think it should be reproducible for multiple CUDA and GPU versions. I just haven't worked on any CUDA code before, and am short on time, so I'd rather not dig too deep.\n<issue_comment>username_0: not yet .. my last building was with a my previous commit ... I will work again in this task in some minutes :)\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 your previous commit had the same failure though (except for the less clear exception message), and it seems quite reproducible. So I think you'll see it now.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Ah, thanks.  @username_0, then I guess just compiling with \"DEBUG=1\" and stepping through the offending code with gdb may be the fastest way.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 thanks! I will try that!\n<issue_comment>username_0: it seems just UpSampleBicubic2d is using upsample_get_value_bounded (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/19630/files#diff-5092da792c30694ee4adf0d0ae2a37c6R171) and upsample_increment_value_bounded (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/19630/files#diff-5092da792c30694ee4adf0d0ae2a37c6R191)\r\n\r\nmaybe the problem could be inside one of these functions ... maybe related to the order of indexes (x, y) ...\r\n\r\nbut the problem seems to be related to cuda block/threads ... so not sure if it is really related to these functions.\n<issue_comment>username_2: The new code uses far more registers than the existing one. I verified that the both versions actually call the offending test case with `1024` in `blockDim`.  So it's very likely a register issue.\r\n\r\n`Existing` uses `64` registers, which seems to be optimal or my card:\r\n\r\n```\r\nptxas info    : 77696 bytes gmem, 72 bytes cmem[3]\r\nptxas info    : Compiling entry function '_Z23bicubic_interp2d_kerneliddb15THCDeviceTensorIdLi4Ei16DefaultPtrTraitsES1_' for 'sm_61'\r\nptxas info    : Function properties for _Z23bicubic_interp2d_kerneliddb15THCDeviceTensorIdLi4Ei16DefaultPtrTraitsES1_\r\n    0 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads\r\nptxas info    : Used 64 registers, 432 bytes cmem[0], 24 bytes cmem[2]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`New` uses `124` registers, which is too much for my card:\r\n\r\n```\r\nptxas info    : 77696 bytes gmem, 72 bytes cmem[3]\r\nptxas info    : Compiling entry function '_ZN2at6native76_GLOBAL__N__52_tmpxft_0000626d_00000000_6_UpSampleBicubic2d_cpp1_ii_b4c1e1f328upsample_bicubic2d_out_frameElddbNS_20PackedTensorAccessorIdLm4ENS_16DefaultPtrTraitsElEES4_' for 'sm_61'\r\nptxas info    : Function properties for _ZN2at6native76_GLOBAL__N__52_tmpxft_0000626d_00000000_6_UpSampleBicubic2d_cpp1_ii_b4c1e1f328upsample_bicubic2d_out_frameElddbNS_20PackedTensorAccessorIdLm4ENS_16DefaultPtrTraitsElEES4_\r\n    0 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads\r\nptxas info    : Used 124 registers, 496 bytes cmem[0], 24 bytes cmem[2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `__launch_bounds__(1024)`, the code again uses `64` registers.\r\n\r\nIf you use `C10_LAUNCH_BOUNDS_1(1024)` **for both kernels**, the tests pass here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow *why* is the regcount higher in the new code? It could be `PackedTensorAccessor`, it could be the fact that many instances of `int` have been changed to `int64_t`. :)\r\n\r\nYou could experiment or just use the launch bounds.  Other code in `native/cuda` seems to use lower bounds for `blockDim`, too.  1024 seems to be an outlier.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 \r\n\r\nit seems it worked locally! thank you so much!

Just want to make sure we have the correct one after porting.\n<issue_comment>username_3: Just as a clarification: I'm OK with having changes which are improvements over the old kernels come in latter patches.\n<issue_comment>username_3: I finished reviewing one of the kernels, and did a cursory scan of the others. In general the patch looks like it's in good shape. I'd suggest that we fix up the major correctness issues (PackedTensorAccessor ref, and int32 versus int64 indexing) and anything small that is easy to fix (for example, double zeroing the array), and leave other improvements for follow ups. Should be ready to land soon!\n<issue_comment>username_0: thanks so much @username_3!\r\nI will let you know when it is ready again for a new review! thanks!\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 @username_3 \r\nnot sure but the errors on CI seems to be related to jenkins ... it seems all these jobs that failed (for building) ran by 01h 01min ... not sure if it is a coincidence ...\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 indeed it looks like all jobs were aborted at the same time. no obvious issues in the build log related to your code. Comparing e.g. the `cuda9-cudnn7` build with a successful one from another PR, it takes 1hr 14min there and your build is about at the place where the other one is after an hour.\r\n\r\nI suggest to just push a new commit to rebuild. Probably a temporary CI hiccup.\n<issue_comment>username_3: I accidentally rebooted Jenkins yesterday which is the likely cause, my apologies.\r\n\r\n@pytorchbot retest this please\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 @username_2 @username_1 \r\n\r\nall tests passed except `pr/caffe2-py2-cuda9.0-cudnn7-windows-build`:\r\n \r\n```\r\n14:43:49 Build timed out (after 180 minutes).

It didn't timeout while running a relevant test, so I judge it to be not your problem.\n<issue_comment>username_3: The launch bounds logic is wrong, but I acknowledge that this is a big patch already; just fix it in a follow up.

FWIW, some recent CI tests in other issues are green.\n<issue_comment>username_2: @pytorchbot retest this please.\n<issue_comment>username_1: same failures.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Is this rebased on the latest master (you can also ask the bot to rebase)?\n<issue_comment>username_0: I rebased that yesterday ... also needed to resolve conflicts because 7 days ago upsample files were changed.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 do you have any idea about what could be this problem? or a way to debug that?\r\nalso it seems some jobs is taking a lot of time to build, for example, for some job the estimate time is 19h .. not sure if it the regular estimate ..\n<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 If you can't reproduce it at home it seems hard to debug other than reading at the diffs again.  I can take a look on Monday, it's getting a bit late here.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Also, has anyone found a way to show the actual hardware used on the CI in detail?\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 I am working in parallel on a paperspace environment .. it tooks a lot of time it is running with 8 cpu cores.\n<issue_comment>username_2: But have you ever been able to reproduce this issue on paperspace?\n<issue_comment>username_1: I can reproduce it locally: Arch Linux, CUDA 10.0, RTX2070 GPU. Given the CI failures, I think it should be reproducible for multiple CUDA and GPU versions. I just haven't worked on any CUDA code before, and am short on time, so I'd rather not dig too deep.\n<issue_comment>username_0: not yet .. my last building was with a my previous commit ... I will work again in this task in some minutes :)\n<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 your previous commit had the same failure though (except for the less clear exception message), and it seems quite reproducible. So I think you'll see it now.\n<issue_comment>username_2: Ah, thanks.  @username_0, then I guess just compiling with \"DEBUG=1\" and stepping through the offending code with gdb may be the fastest way.\n<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 thanks!

The first time JIT/TorchScript sees an input it will specialize and do optimizations against that input, so when comparing performance please allow a compilation time and runtime optimization warmup for the input.\n<issue_comment>username_4: @username_3 That made a big difference to my traced module too.
